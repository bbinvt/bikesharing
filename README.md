# bikesharing

## Overview
#### Purpose
This project focuses on interpreting a large city bike sharing data set by creating unique visualisations to better understand user behaviors. Using Tableau Public we created unique plots, combined plots into dashboards, and finally created a unique Story to share with our potential investors. 

#### Resources
- Some data transformation was necessary and performed within a jupyter notebook contained here: [NYC_CitiBike_Challenge.ipynb](https://github.com/bbinvt/bikesharing/blob/13900b8fb8d81870a2701043215c73abcd3485f4/NYC_CitiBike_Challenge.ipynb)
- The Story created on Tableau can be found here: [NYC Citi Bike Analysis](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/brennan.berardo/viz/NYCCitiBikeAnalysis_16702049935430/NYCCitiBikeAnalysis)

## Results
During this exercise we were able to make many useful visualizations of our data. 
### How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders?

From the figure above we can see that the bikes are primarily used for trips of a short duration typically under 10 minutes. We can also see when rides are separated by gender Males have a peak of 5 minutes while females peak at 6 minutes. Interestingly the number of Male riders far outpaces their counterparts.

### How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders.

The above figure shows an excerpt from the Tableau Story - we can see from the heat map that Thursday is the most popular day of the week for bike rides.

When the rides per hour by day of the week are separated by Gender we see that Thursday remains the most popular day of the week, we can also see that Males make up a greater majority of the total trips. 

### The number of trips by gender and by customer type

We can see that "Subscribers" are much more likely to take a trip on any given day of the week. 


## Summary
The data suggests that the investors can move forward with their decision to invest though they would be wise to investigate further. Two suggested studies:
- What are the age demographics of riders broken down by gender?
- Why do males far out represent females in the total count of riders? Are their marketing efforts or a change of bikes available that would make females more likely to ride?
