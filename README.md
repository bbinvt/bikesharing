# bikesharing

## Overview
#### Purpose
This project focuses on interpreting a large city bike sharing data set by creating unique visualisations to better understand user behaviors. Using Tableau Public we created unique plots, combined plots into dashboards, and finally created a unique Story to share with our potential investors. 

#### Resources
- Some data transformation was necessary and performed within a jupyter notebook contained here: [NYC_CitiBike_Challenge.ipynb](https://github.com/bbinvt/bikesharing/blob/13900b8fb8d81870a2701043215c73abcd3485f4/NYC_CitiBike_Challenge.ipynb)
- The Story created on Tableau can be found here: [NYC Citi Bike Analysis](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/brennan.berardo/viz/NYCCitiBikeAnalysis_16702049935430/NYCCitiBikeAnalysis)
